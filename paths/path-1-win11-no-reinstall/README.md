# Path 1 – Windows 11 (No Reinstall)

## ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Before You Continue ⚠️⚠️⚠️

Every step in this path assumes your data is protected.

Before touching drivers, cleanup steps, or system configuration:
- You **must** create a system restore point
- You **must** back up important files externally

If you skip backups, that risk is on you.

➡️ **Complete the backup steps here before continuing:**
