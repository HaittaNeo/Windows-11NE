# Windows 11NE Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Why not Linux?

Linux **can** work for gaming and streaming in certain scenarios.

However, this guide is written for **everyday users and creators** who want:
- Fewer setup steps
- Less research
- Minimal manual configuration

While many tools *can* be made to work on Linux, it often requires:
- Additional system tweaks
- Compatibility layers
- Driver workarounds
- Community patches
- Watching multiple guides or videos just to get core tools functioning

For gamers, VTubers, and streamers, this extra overhead adds risk, especially for live production workflows.

Core tools such as:
- Face tracking software
- Capture card drivers
- GPU encoding
- Kernel-level anti-cheat games

are still best supported on standard Windows releases.

This guide focuses on **reducing friction**, not adding more steps.

## Why not Windows LTSC or IoT editions?

LTSC and IoT editions are very stable and largely binary compatible.

They are designed for:
- Fixed-purpose systems
- Long deployment cycles
- Minimal feature change

Creator systems are the opposite:
- Constantly evolving software
- Frequent plugin updates
- Hardware requiring up-to-date drivers
- Tools that assume consumer Windows editions

For gamers and VTubers, standard Windows releases provide:
- Better driver testing
- Better compatibility with games and streaming tools
- Easier vendor and community support
- Faster recovery when something breaks mid-stream

This guide prioritizes **practical reliability** over niche configurations.

## Can Linux or LTSC work?

Yes, for the right users, with the right expectations.

If you enjoy:
- Deep system configuration
- Troubleshooting edge cases
- Researching workarounds

Linux or LTSC may be a good fit, especially on a secondary machine.

This project is aimed at the **lowest-resistance option for the most people**.

## TL;DR

- Linux and LTSC aren’t bad choices
- They require more effort and research
- Windows 11NE is about making life simpler, not harder
